Programming Problems
====================

Hello, this is a collection of solutions to programming problems I've worked on
over the past couple years. After finding bits and pieces of these problems all
over my hard drive, I decided to clean them up and organize them into a single
repo. I try my best to only include working solutions. They may not be the
clearest or most optimized since I want to represent solutions I wrote with
minimal help. Remember to try a problem on your own before looking at the
answers!

The problems come from these sources:

+ [Canadian Computing Competition (ccc)]{http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/Contests/past_contests.html#ccc}
+ [ECOO Programming Contest (ecoo)]{http://ecoocs.org/past.php}
+ [Programming Challenges]{http://uva.onlinejudge.org/}
+ [Project Euler (pe)]{http://projecteuler.net/}
+ [Sphere Online Judge (spoj)]{http://www.spoj.com/}
